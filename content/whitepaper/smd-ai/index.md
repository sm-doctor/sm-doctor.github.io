## SMD-AI Construction Plan

> Building the SMD-AI Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment System (including generative AI and wearable health monitoring devices) based on the DeepSeek-v large language model, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology, MCP protocol, knowledge base, and SMD case database.

### **I. Technical Introduction**  
1. **SMD-LLM (Large Language Model)**  
- **Core Capabilities**: Enables language understanding, generation, and logical reasoning through pre-trained models.  
- **Key Challenges**: Knowledge cutoff (dependent on training data timeframe), factual errors, lack of real-time information, and insufficient domain-specific expertise.  

2. **SMD-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
- **Core Capabilities**: Enhances output accuracy and relevance by retrieving and integrating external knowledge (structured/unstructured data) into the LLM generation process.  
- **Technical Approach**:  
  - **Retrieval Module**: Recalls candidate documents from knowledge bases using vector similarity (e.g., embeddings) or semantic matching (e.g., BM25).  
  - **Generation Module**: LLM synthesizes retrieved information to generate responses with controlled formatting (e.g., source citations).  

3. **SMD-Knowledge Base**  
- **Core Capabilities**: Stores domain-specific structured/semi-structured data.  
- **Role**: Provides reliable knowledge for RAG, addressing LLM limitations like outdated information and lack of domain expertise.  

4. **SMD-Case Database**  
- **Core Capabilities**: Stores structured/semi-structured case data on disease rehabilitation.  
- **Role**: Supplies evidence-based treatment cases to improve diagnostic precision.

### **II. Application Scenarios**  
- **Scenario**: Precision Q&A Diagnosis System.  
- **Workflow**: User query → RAG retrieves authoritative documents from knowledge/case databases → LLM synthesizes information → Generates sourced answers.  
- **Advantage**: Avoids LLM hallucinations and enhances response credibility.  

---

### **III. Synergistic Advantages**  
1. **Accuracy**: Validates LLM outputs via knowledge bases to reduce hallucinations.  
2. **Timeliness**: Integrates real-time data to cover post-training events.  
3. **Domain Depth**: Compensates for LLM gaps in specialized knowledge.  
4. **Controllability**: Guides LLM outputs using retrieval results for compliance.

### **IV. Summary**  
- **SMD-LLM**: The "brain" for generative capabilities, requiring external knowledge supplementation.  
- **SMD-RAG**: The "bridge" connecting LLM and knowledge bases to resolve factual issues.  
- **SMD-MCP**: Standardizes interactions between AI systems and external data/services.  
- **SMD-Knowledge Base**: The reliable knowledge foundation for vertical applications.  
- **SMD-Case Database**: The evidence-based case foundation for precise medical scenarios.  

> The integration of these components, and future deployment in embodied AI robots, will advance SMD-AI from "general dialogue" to "specialized diagnostic agent."
