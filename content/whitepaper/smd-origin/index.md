{{< alert "sun" >}}The 'Human Health Program' —— Explore the ultimate solution for the upgrading of human health and the medical and health care industry.{{< /alert >}}

## Project Motivations: Four Major Topics

### I. Medical Dilemmas

> When various chronic diseases and sudden epidemics have become the main causes of human death, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and diabetes have become the great enemies of mankind. The mainstream traditional Chinese and Western medicine still lacks completely effective solutions. Reflecting on the methodology of modern medical and health care philosophy is the primary work to solve human health problems.

### II. Industry Dilemmas
> When medical care and health preservation have become a means of making money, there are often contradictions and conflicts between pursuing economic benefits and saving lives. This directly leads to the fact that inexpensive and efficient medical technologies and means hardly have a place to survive. The transformation of the industrial model from the public welfare of medical care to the commercialization of medical and health care services should become an important social issue.

### III. Social Pain Points
> On the one hand, there is a huge financial expenditure of the state in the medical industry. On the other hand, ordinary people are plunged into poverty or return to poverty due to illness. When one person has a serious illness, the whole family suffers. Having a healthy, happy life without diseases has almost become a luxury for mankind.

### IV. New Scientific Revolution
> The scientific research motivation of the SMD project. The development of life sciences is an inevitable trend in the advancement of human civilization, and the evolution of medicine is inevitably the development of life sciences. (The development of traditional Chinese medicine <science> will not only trigger a revolution in human cognition but also a revolution in modern science —— Qian Xuesen).
