## **I. The First Principles of Health**

<ol>

### 1. The Concept of First Principles
The First Principles can be traced back to the philosophical system of the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. In his work *Metaphysics*, he proposed:

> **"In every systematic inquiry, there exist First Principles. They are the most fundamental propositions or assumptions that cannot be omitted, deleted, or violated."**  
> （*"In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these."*）  

#### (1) The Original English Text
In Aristotle's *Metaphysics* (Book IV, Part 3), the original text (translated from ancient Greek) is as follows:
> **"For it is owing to their wonder that men both now begin and at first began to philosophize; they wondered originally at the obvious difficulties, then advanced 
little by little and stated difficulties about the greater matters, e.g. about the phenomena of the moon and those of the sun and of the stars, and about the genesis of 
the universe. And a man who is puzzled and wonders thinks himself ignorant (whence even the lover of myth is in a sense a lover of wisdom, for the myth is composed of 
wonders); therefore since they philosophized in order to escape from ignorance, evidently they were pursuing science in order to know, and not for any utilitarian end.
"**  

#### (2) Modern Applications
The scientific methodology of "First Principles Thinking" often mentioned in modern scientific and business fields (such as Elon Musk) means:
- **Decompose the problem into the most fundamental and irreducible truths**, and then reconstruct the solution from scratch.
- **Compared with traditional empirical thinking (analogical reasoning)**, First Principles place more emphasis on the underlying logic.

#### (3) Key Differences
|  | **First Principles** | **Analogical Reasoning** |
|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | Start from the most basic physical/mathematical laws | Refer to existing experiences or similar cases |
| **Example** | Elon Musk calculates the cost of rocket materials (instead of buying directly) | "Other companies are doing this, so we should do it too." |
| **Advantages** | Break through and innovate, avoid path dependence | Make quick decisions with lower risks |

Living organisms are organic systems that constantly interact with the environment in terms of matter, energy, and information. Some interactions are beneficial to health, while others can lead to diseases. The healing of life should be a systematic work based on the three aspects of matter, energy, and information in all scenarios.

{{< timelineItem icon="triangle-exclamation" header="III. Self-Organization of Life" subheader="Three Laws of Self-Healing of Living Organisms - Three Key Considerations for Health Preservation:"  badge="Epistemology">}}
<ol>
 <li>Living organisms can heal themselves.</li>
 <li>The self-healing ability of living organisms can be inhibited.</li>
 <li>The self-healing ability of living organisms can be reactivated.</li>
</ol>
Living organisms are constantly faced with various physical and chemical damages from the environment. The self-healing of life occurs continuously within the organism. However, this ability cannot always function effectively. For example, in the case of various chronic diseases, the so-called healing is to reactivate the self-healing of life through certain specific means.
The essence of healing is the self-healing of life. The self-organization of life includes the self-balance, self-purification, self-immunity, and self-healing of living organisms.

## **II. Methodology of Health Systems Engineering**

<ol>

### 1. Overview of Systems Engineering
> Systems engineering is a discipline that takes **system thinking** as its core and integrates technology, management, and engineering practices through interdisciplinary methods to solve complex system problems. It focuses on how to design, optimize, and manage a system composed of multiple interrelated elements to ensure its overall performance is optimal.
Systems engineering is the "top-level design" methodology for solving complex problems. Its core lies in integrating fragmented elements into an organic whole through structured thinking and interdisciplinary tools. In this era of technology, it is everywhere. The goal of systems engineering has always been to make the "system work better" — more efficiently, reliably, and sustainably. The following elaborates on its definition, core principles, methodology, applications, and trends.

### 2. Core Definitions and Essence
- **System**: Construct a holistic health solution from interacting and interdependent elements (such as the environment, diet, work and rest, emotions, and ideological concepts, etc.).  
- **Systems engineering**: Use scientific methods (analysis, modeling, optimization, simulation, etc.) to plan, manage, and control the **full life cycle** health status of the living system.

### 3. Core Principles and Characteristics
1. **Wholeness (Global Perspective)**  
   - Oppose "local optimality" and emphasize the overall effect of the system. For example, in health healing work, it is necessary to emphasize the combined treatment of the body and mind and the integration of medical care and health care, rather than just emphasizing the use of a single therapy such as Western medicine or just using drugs.  
2. **Interdisciplinary Integration**  
   - Integrate knowledge from multiple fields such as engineering, mathematics, management, and computer science. For example, in health healing work, it is necessary to conduct a multi-factor analysis of the causes of diseases and use data analysis from big data knowledge bases and case bases to formulate healing plans.  
3. **Full Life Cycle Management**  
   - Manage the whole process of health preservation, from preventing disease, preventing impending disease, to treating existing diseases, and formulate health plans for the full life cycle of patients.  
4. **Uncertainty and Dynamic Adaptation**  
   - Respond to environmental changes and dynamically adjust the plan through a feedback mechanism (such as obtaining relevant data from wearable devices for health index detection).

### 4. Core Methodology and Tools

#### (1) Classical Methodology  
- **Hall's Three-Dimensional Matrix**  
  - **Time Dimension**: Different time stages of different healing methods;  
  - **Logic Dimension**: Define the causes of diseases, set goals, conduct system synthesis, analysis and optimization, and implement decision-making for health healing plans;  
  - **Knowledge Dimension**: Multidisciplinary knowledge (such as control theory, operations research, and health management).  
- **V-Model (Systems Engineering Life Cycle Model)**  
  - The "V" represents the verification of the healing plan and the integration of methods (plan testing → sub-plan testing → overall verification) to ensure that the plan design aligns with health goals.  

#### (2) Management Tools  
- **Health Management Tools**: Life process management (DMAIC/DMADV), WBS (Work Breakdown Structure for Healing), Gantt chart, Critical Path Method (CPM), to ensure that complex factors are controllable.  
- **System Health Plan Design**: Define the relationships between therapies, the time and space points adopted, etc.

## **III. Integrated Medical Care and Health Care Therapy**

<ol>

### 1. Systemic Therapy

> Systemic Medicine is an organically integrated healing method and a comprehensive treatment model that spans disciplines and theories. By organically combining multiple treatment methods, theoretical systems, or intervention means, it formulates personalized plans according to the multi-dimensional needs of individuals in terms of physiology, psychology, and society, so as to achieve more comprehensive and efficient treatment effects. Its core lies in breaking through the limitations of single therapies, emphasizing that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts", and forming a systemic healing method. It is the organic integration of the effective parts of the four healing methods, namely the integration of medical care and health care, traditional Chinese and Western medical therapies, psychological therapies, and natural therapies, with different weighting strategies.

### 2. Core Principles
1. **Personalized Integration**: Select suitable combinations of therapies according to individual characteristics (such as symptoms, cultural background, and values), rather than mechanically stacking them.
2. **Systemic Perspective**: Pay attention to the interactions among physiology, psychology, and the social environment. For example, psychological problems may be related to physical diseases or social pressures, and comprehensive interventions are required.
3. **Evidence-Based**: Prioritize methods that have been scientifically verified to be effective to ensure the rationality and safety of the integration.
4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Flexibly adjust the plan according to the progress of treatment to avoid rigidly following a fixed pattern.

### 3. Full-Scenario Application of Health Healing

#### (1) Integrated Therapies in Psychotherapy
- **Theoretical Integration**: Combine the advantages of different psychological schools. For example:
  - **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) + Psychoanalysis**: Use CBT to improve current cognitive biases while exploring the root causes of childhood traumas through psychoanalysis.
  - **Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) + Humanistic Therapy**: Train emotional awareness through mindfulness and establish a therapeutic relationship through empathetic communication.
- **Technical Integration**: Integrate techniques such as relaxation training, narrative therapy, and family system constellation to address complex psychological problems (such as post-traumatic stress disorder and comorbid depression and anxiety).

#### (2) Integrated Therapies in the Medical Field
- **Integration of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine**: For example, in the treatment of tumors, Western medical surgery/radiotherapy and chemotherapy are combined with traditional Chinese medicine to regulate immunity and relieve side effects.
- **Integration of Functional Medicine**: Improve chronic diseases (such as diabetes and autoimmune diseases) through comprehensive means such as diet, nutrition, exercise, and psychological intervention.
- **Integration of Rehabilitation Therapy**: Combine physical therapy (such as exercise rehabilitation) with psychological intervention to help patients restore physical functions and rebuild psychological resilience at the same time (such as patients with postoperative depression).

#### (3) Health Management and Prevention
- Integrate nutrition science, sports science, and psychology to formulate personalized health plans (such as for people with stress-induced obesity, combining diet adjustment, mindfulness stress reduction, and regular exercise).

### 3. Advantages and Challenges
| **Advantages** | **Challenges** |
|---------|----------|
| - Adapt to complex problems (such as comorbidities and multi-factor pathogenesis)<br>- Take into account both "symptom relief" and "overall health"<br>- Flexibly respond to individual differences | - High requirements for practitioners (need to master the theories and techniques of multiple therapies)<br>- Improper integration may lead to logical conflicts or dilution of therapeutic effects<br>- Lack of a unified evaluation standard, making it difficult to quantify the effects |

### 4. Conclusion
> Systemic Medicine is an embodiment of the "people-oriented" concept in the modern health field. By breaking down disciplinary boundaries, it provides more comprehensive solutions to complex problems. However, its success depends on the professional integration ability of practitioners and the accurate grasp of individual needs. In the future, it needs to be further standardized and scientific within the framework of evidence-based medicine.
